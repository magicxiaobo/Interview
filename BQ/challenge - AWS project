challenge - AWS:

Challenge 1：

Access EC2 from browser
1.connect ssh to EC2 instance
2. install httpd: yum install httpd
3. go to /var/www/html and create a index.html file 
4. check and start up httpd
5. Access the ip (52.27.53.57) in the browser


I found I can't access this EC2 ip address. I found the reason after searched a lot online. The reason is the default inbound status of security groups of newly created EC2 instance is SSH allowed only. I have to go to its security groups and add an extra rule (http) to it.


Security group is like a firewall. It can define the inbound and outbound. 
it denied HTTP access to inbound and it has only one ssh rule. It allow everything to outbound



big challenge is：
use sql file  to generate RDS data, this is the big challennge

Because new to AWS, the command and the process are complicated. 

(1) sign to AWS console
(2) Go to IAM create new user/group, user policy using IAMFullAccess
(3) EC2 create key-value pairs
(4) Go to Elastic Beanstalk - Creat new application. and set up RDS at the meantime (username / password)
(5) SSH connect to EC2
(6) Install mysql-server on EC2 and start it
(7) connect RDS instance to EC2 (mysql -h ~~~~[rds address] -P 3306 -u bookstore -p)
(8) UPload sql file to EC2 instance (难点就是：需要include EC2 pem file in the command), otherwise always failed.
(9) Generate RDS data using sql file
